# Privacy Policy for QuickText Chrome Extension

**Last Updated: May 21, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use the QuickText Chrome Extension (the "Extension").

## 1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

The QuickText Extension collects and stores:
- Text parameter pairs that you create and save within the Extension
- Extension preferences and settings
- Backup data of your parameters

All of this information is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API (both sync and local storage). Your data is synchronized across your Chrome browsers where you are logged in with the same Google account.

## 2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

The information we collect is used solely to provide the text replacement functionality of the Extension. Specifically:
- Your parameter data is used to perform text replacements in web forms
- Backup data is used only for restoration purposes if needed
- No data is used for marketing, analytics, or any other purpose beyond the core functionality of the Extension

## 3. DATA SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

We do not:
- Sell or rent your personal information to third parties
- Share your information with third-party services or analytics providers
- Transmit your data to external servers

The only data sharing that occurs is through Chrome's built-in sync functionality, which synchronizes your settings across your Chrome browsers where you are signed in with the same Google account.

## 4. DATA SECURITY

Your data is stored locally on your device and, if you use Chrome Sync, in your Google account's synchronized data. The Extension does not implement additional encryption beyond what Chrome provides.

## 5. YOUR RIGHTS

You have complete control over your data. You can:
- Export your data at any time through the Extension's interface
- Delete your data by removing parameters or uninstalling the Extension
- Create and restore backups through the Extension's interface

## 6. CHROME API USAGE

This extension uses the following Chrome APIs:
- `storage.sync`: To store and synchronize your parameters across devices

- `runtime.onInstalled`: To initialize the extension on installation
- `runtime.onMessage`: To handle communication between components

## 7. PERMISSIONS

## 8. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this privacy policy.
